This is my bachelor diploma project.
Utility written in java and scala allows user manage graph with gaussian distributed edges.

The model itself is written in Scala and GUI is written in Java with Swing.
GUI for this utility is in separate module, and thus is not tightly coupled with the model itself.
It allows usage of model independently from the GUI
